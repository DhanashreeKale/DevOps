### Overview
``` 
1)	Selenium Grid is one of the four components of Selenium. 

2)	It is used to run test cases across multiple machines having different OS and different browser type or versions. 

3)	It supports distributed test execution. 

4)	We write the test cases and execute them on our local machine. But in large organization, there are multiple test cases and multiple servers in the picture, and it is not possible to run all the test cases on our local or a same machine. Also, these test cases must be distributed across these multiple and different servers.

5)	A selenium hub is the main controller which distributes all the test cases (the automation test cases created on our local machine or same machine) to the right nodes upon requests. Nodes are nothing but different machines/OS with different platforms like Firefox on Ubuntu or Safari on MacOS.
